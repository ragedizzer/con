1. Overview

The Convention Management System (CMS, codename ConScraper) is a web platform for fans, creators, and businesses to discover, track, and manage convention opportunities across the U.S. in comics, pop culture, anime, horror, movies, and related fandoms.

The system:

1. Scrapes convention information (dates, categories, signup links).


2. Stores data in a structured PHP/MySQL database.


3. Lets users create accounts to follow conventions and sign-up windows.


4. Sends reminders to user emails before and when registrations open.


5. Prepares for SuiteCRM integration as a future module.

2. Goals & Non-Goals

Goals

Centralized database of U.S. conventions by category.

Accurate tracking of signup windows for multiple roles (attendee, press, pro, artist, exhibitor, vendor, etc.).

User accounts with watchlist + reminders.

Automated email notifications (before + on open date).

Scalable scraping pipeline for new cons & updates.

Extendable into SuiteCRM module for business workflows.


Non-Goals (Phase 1)

Ticket purchasing or badge fulfillment (we only link).

Mobile app (web-first, responsive design).

Social features (reviews, ratings, chat).



---

3. Users & Personas

1. Fan/Attendee

Wants to know when badges open, track multiple cons, and never miss registration.


2. Creator/Artist/Exhibitor

Needs reminders for artist alley, exhibitor, vendor deadlines.

May manage multiple conventions per year.


3. Press/Professional

Uses system to track press/pro sign-up windows.


4. Business/Publisher

Larger teams tracking multiple conventions, need SuiteCRM integration.



---

4. System Architecture

High-Level Flow

1. Scraper Engine → collects con data from official sites.


2. Database Layer (MySQL) → stores conventions, categories, signups, users, reminders.


3. Web Application (PHP/Laravel) → user interface + APIs.


4. Reminder Service (Cron + Mailer) → generates/sends scheduled email reminders.


5. SuiteCRM Integration Layer → REST API / module for business use.



Tech Stack

Backend: PHP 8.2 (Laravel preferred, Slim/CodeIgniter as alternative).

Database: MySQL 8.x.

Frontend: Blade templates or Vue.js (optional SPA).

Scraping: GuzzleHTTP + Symfony DomCrawler.

Email: SendGrid/Mailgun (SMTP).

Hosting: LAMP stack or Docker containerized.



---

5. Database Schema (Simplified)

Conventions

id, name, website_url, location, start_date, end_date, categories


Convention_Signups

id, convention_id, type (attendee, press, artist, exhibitor, vendor), link_url, open_at, close_at


Users

id, email, password_hash, timezone, default_lead_days


Watchlist

user_id, convention_id, signup_type_id, lead_days, notify_before, notify_on_open


Reminders

id, user_id, convention_id, trigger_at, kind (before_open, on_open, event_start), status



---

6. Core Features (Phase 1 MVP)

1. Convention Scraping Engine

Crawl convention sites.

Extract dates, signup links, categories.

Normalize into database.

Admin dashboard for validation.



2. User Accounts & Authentication

Register/login (email/password).

Email verification.

Basic profile (timezone, default reminder days).



3. Convention Directory

Search/filter by category, location, dates.

Convention detail pages (links to signup forms).



4. Watchlist & Reminders

Add conventions or signup windows to personal watchlist.

Auto-generate reminders (before open date & on open).

Email notifications with direct signup link.





---

7. Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

Calendar/ICS export (sync with Google/Outlook).

Advanced search (by region, size, guests).

Mobile app (React Native wrapper).

CRM Module for SuiteCRM:

Mirror conventions & signups in SuiteCRM modules.

Surface reminders as SuiteCRM tasks/events.


Team accounts for publishers/businesses.

Analytics: which cons have most signups tracked.



---

8. Security & Compliance

Passwords stored with Argon2id hashing.

All dates/times stored in UTC; localized per user.

Encrypted SMTP for email.

Rate limiting on scrapers.

Respect robots.txt; manual review for sensitive sites.



---

9. Risks & Mitigations

Scraping fragility: Sites change layouts → Mitigation: regex + manual admin review.

Spam emails: Reminder floods → Mitigation: unsubscribe link + per-user cap.

Data completeness: Some cons don’t post signup dates early → Mitigation: allow “unknown” placeholders + user-submitted corrections.

SuiteCRM integration complexity: Start with API sync before full module.



---

10. Roadmap

Phase 1 (MVP, 2–3 months)

Scraper engine + admin review

Con DB schema + user accounts

Watchlist + reminders + email sender

Public site with directory/search


Phase 2 (3–6 months)

Calendar exports

Mobile-friendly enhancements

SuiteCRM proof-of-concept module


Phase 3 (6–12 months)

Team/business accounts

Advanced analytics & dashboards

Sponsorship/ad placement



---

11. Example User Flow

1. User signs up with email.


2. Searches “Anime cons in California 2026”.


3. Clicks “Anime Expo” → sees dates + signup windows.


4. Adds Press Application to watchlist with 14-day early reminder.


5. System sends:

“Reminder: Anime Expo Press opens in 14 days.”

“Press signups are now OPEN!”
